# Wikipedia Matrix

A simple command line, java based, Wikipedia table extractor.

## Purpose 

Wikipedia Matrix is a software whose goal is to extract existing table from a wikipedia’s page through the HTML or by the Wikitext.

In order to do so, the software needs to verify that the page/URL is from Wikipedia. It also verify if the URL exists.

If the page contains no table, the software will inform you that the page had no valid table.
For each existing table in the Wikipedia’s page, there will be two .csv files created : one from the wikitext analysis and one for the HTML one
